# Deathroll

## What is this?
Deathroll is a small java dice game I created during my IT-traineeship. It is partly based on the game known as Deathrolling played in the popular MMO World of Warcraft.
This game differs in its goal, which is explained below. The game is currently only playable from the IDE console.

## How is it played?
Deathrolling is a luck-based game played by rolling between one and a chosen number.
You start by choosing a number to start rolling from, and whoever's next rolls from the number you roll.
The goal is to roll as low as possible without rolling 1. You get the choice to continue rolling after each of your rolls, or to stop.
If you stop, the computer keeps rolling until it either rolls lower than you (which means you lose) or rolls 1, in which case you win.
Whoever reaches 1 first loses.

## What can I do with it?
Feel free to try it out!
